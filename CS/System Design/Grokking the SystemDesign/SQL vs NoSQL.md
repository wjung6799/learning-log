# SQL vs. NoSQL

## SQL

Relational Databases store data in rows and columns. Each row contains all the info about one entity and each column contains all the seperate data points.

MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL, SQLite, Postgres, and MariaDB

## NoSQL

**Key-Value Stores**: Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. Key is an attribute name which is linked to a value.

ex) Redis, Voldemort and Dynamo

**Document Databases**: Data is stored in documents. Basically like a Json blob

**Wide-Column Databases**: It's not quite a table. But the rows are made of flexible columns

**Graph Databases**: Best represnatation of this database would be nodes of graph

## High level differences

**Storage**

SQL stores data entity that is represented with a row and a column. NoSQL databases have different data storage models. (key, document, columnar and graph)

**Schema**

In SQL, Schemas are fixed but in NoSQL they're dynamic.

**Querying**

Sql uses SQL and NoSQL it's inconsistent. Depends on the database

**Scalability**
