Welp shit got lost

But basically 

Big O is one big generalization (They are often wrong)

The Design Decision processs:
1. Evaluate pros and cons
2. Decide on a design
3. Defend your design decision


## Algorithmic Analysis

### Code Modeling

- Cost Model: An anaylsis mindest to express the resource whose growth rate is being measured
- For simplicity, we'll discuss everything in terms of run time today
  - But other cost mdoels exist! For example, storage space is common

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/149058952-68ada537-e307-4375-837a-ff648072cfc0.png)

### Asymptotic Analysis

I know this

But Big O is like the sig fig.


We do this precise estimation because It's almost impossible to stare at code and know the "true" constants.

In real life application, real constant run time does matter.

But reason we want Big O analysis is

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/149062470-3febca88-6ee9-48fd-bcd8-031fb22c4293.png)

#### Big O Does not have to be tight.

ex) 10n<sup>2</sup> is O(n<sup>3</sup>) because Big O is simply just an upper bound

#### Big - &Omega;

Omega is the lower bound and also it doesn't have to be tight.

#### Big &theta;

Big &theta; is "equal to"
- My code takes "exactly" this long to run
- Except for constant factors and lower order terms
- Only exist when big O == Big Omega

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/149067772-5a52736f-2182-42ef-801f-274496088150.png)

### Case Analysis

Case: a description of inputs/state for an algorithm that is specific enough to build a code model (runtime function) whose only parameter is the input size
- Case Analysis is our tool for reasoning about all vriation other than n
- Occurs during the code -> function step instead of function 0 -> analysis

Case Anaylsis is seperate from Asymptotic analysis

Case Analysis when runtime is affected by something other than n

ex) Linear Search vs isPrime method

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/149068944-5ef17a04-bcc5-4396-88ba-1ed07e77eb75.png)

In industry what they mean by big-O is "Tight Big O"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/149879684-8ca78b47-ddc3-4537-b73a-bf611a3bbd67.png)


So this is what it means to do case analysis (Probably useless in job interviews)

However maybe could be discussed on the job.



When to do case analysis
1. Can you exit loops early?
2. Can you return early?
3. Are some branches slower than others?

Determine "what" inputs can cause different outcomes not how big.

Best case in case analysis has to be consistent even with growing size of n

Writing Recurrence

T(n) = {
something non-recursive (base case)
recursive work

### Tree Method

Just drawing out function call tree

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/149964280-2a477bf7-73cb-4ee2-aa10-dd810ad14972.png)


Map shit is done

Direct Access Map -> Making a map using array (big array, resizing to any number of index (keyvalue))
SimpleHashMap -> Using mod to optimize direct access map a little bit better. If there is an overlap it will just loop through and find an open spot to store the value.


**Seperate Chaining hashmp is the way to go**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/158925497-75f7bb8f-c836-4a4d-9342-17b6c0400421.png)


Worst case does exist where hashing will go to one index but if well implemented it should be okay.

### Hashing

Hashing Review:

We resize when load factor reaches some sort of threshold.

- Considerations for Has Functions:
   1. Deterministic - same input should generate the same output.
   2. Efficient - reasonable runtime.
   3. Uniform - inputs spread evenly across output range.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/159233982-046a5346-7c6c-4a27-8e77-8e8670d0a61a.png)

Focus on what each hasing methods are trying to solve.

But in practice Hashing is basically implemented so that we can just use it straight up.

Content Hashing: Applications
 - Caching:
    - Whether to know a new version is available, you just download the hash and compare. If the hash value is different, that means there is a new version available.
   
 - File Verification
    - Same Implementation
    - Can be used to verify files on your machine, files spread across multiple servers, etc.
    - If the file's hash matches it means verified
 
 - Fingerprinting
    - Fit hashes ("identification)
    - Ad tracking ("identification)

### Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbCjYKhgLdE&list=PLKSaHgNv33YitEFQDDKci04EhznR_sRn3&index=27

Aside: Anything Can Be a Mp

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/159646747-66341e2c-e84a-4d7a-804e-dfe999d0b041.png)

Asking for Invariant is a good thing.


How to make a self balancing Tree

1. Red Black Tree
2. AVL Tree

In this course, we deal with AVL tree.

AVL Invariant
 - For every node, the height of its left and right subtrees may only differ by at most 1

All AVL tree must be a binary search tree.

1. Keep Track of heights
2. If imbalance detected:
   1. Detach subtress
   2. Rotate
   3. Attach subtrees



**LEFT ROTATION**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/159654791-72a98bab-8ed3-4068-abfc-e404551f9bc0.png)

**RIGHT ROTATION**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/159654839-59d92a37-9b0c-4b5a-a02a-72b4ee1f46b9.png)

**RIGHT/LEFT ROTATION**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/159655300-bfff8f8e-391b-4a33-a165-17bc88512410.png)

First rotation happens in the subtree and the second rotation happens on the entire tree.

**LEFT/RIGHT ROTATION**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/159655712-6b609ff6-29fb-45b4-ad55-2da14e427faf.png)


AVL Tree Implementation

Step 1 - Perform normal BST

Step 2 - Update the height of the ancestor node

Step 3 - Get the balance factor

Step 4 - If the node is unbalanced, then try out the 4 cases

### Learning about Cache

When you grab an array it brings a chunk back from the back. (So it doesn't have to go back)

Characterizing Cache-Friendly Programs
1. Spatial locality - tendency for programs to access locations nearby to recent locations
2. Temporal locality - tendency for programs to access data that was recently accessed.

Programs with spatial and temporal locality benefit the most from caching.

Linked List do not exhibit strong spatial locality!
Don't get the same cache benefits.

B+ Tree is better than AVL tree in case where we are using disk and ram situation.

B+ Tree is disk friendly because you only have to access disk h times and loop through m times

## REAL IMPORTANT SHIT

### Unweighted Shortest Graph

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-path-unweighted-graph/

Use BFS to make a parent tracking thingy and trace it back up

### Weighted Shortest Graph

How to calculate Dijkstra's Runtime

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/162895436-33bda416-26f2-40d6-b23c-7008b6d7bc1e.png)

Because number of edges are fixed and number of vertices are fixed we don't multiply V and E together

### Topological Sort

Can you always topo sort a graph? -> NO

It can only be topologically sorted if a graph is DIRECTED ACYLCIC GRAPH

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/162898265-c4de6a31-6697-420e-b24a-e3f67eb23fdc.png)

Topo sort does not matter if edges are weigted

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/


### Reductions

A reduction is a problem solving strategy that involves using an algorithm for problem Q to solve a different problem P

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/162900690-7af23cc5-5f5f-4070-820e-2c790aee4919.png)


So bascially changing your problem into a know problem so you can do the same thing (funneling or bottlenecking a problem)


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/162904051-0f18f16c-7061-4374-8fbb-41774908aa5d.png)

Dijkstra is used to make a seam carving... Weight -> differences in pixel

### Minimum Spanning Trees

Spanning Trees are some sort of tree structure(there is only one connection between nodes and it is acyclic)

Minimum Spanning Tree is a spanning tree that has the minimum cost.

### Prim's Algorithm

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/163137721-c404eb3d-c042-4f11-97f3-2390974df73d.png)

MSTs don't have a source vertex.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHlOA6cfFh4&list=PLKSaHgNv33YitEFQDDKci04EhznR_sRn3&index=59


### Kruskal's Algorithm

Use Disjoint set -> go by smallest edges and if there is cycle, skip.

Project 4: Creating Maze (seems worth a try implementing with python)

### Disjoint Sets and Quick Finds

The Disjoint set that I know of

### Quick Union

Quick Union speeds up union process.

Use something called uptree which goes to same parent eventually.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/163533595-443bd9a5-d3a2-48b4-8767-4e744b6b1e81.png)

if larger tree becomes the root entity, it will work better.

### Weighted Quick Union

https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/WeightedQuickUnionUF.java.html


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/163703467-73f47520-e035-4352-9db7-a9a0c6440702.png)

Q1) Why is E > V.... I don't get it
Q2) Am I confusing how to count Es and Vs

Because When we are talking about MST's input set, it's fully connected tree hence E <= V^2


## Sorting

### Selection Sort

Finding minimum value from unsorted array and placing it. 

### Insertion Sort

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/164604209-34cb1e93-958d-4886-a12f-3b67820ecc0b.png)

move your right element until you find the right place in the array


Insertion Sort is more stable than selection sort because selection sort can move the order of the element (if they have the same comparable value)


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/164611860-93dd9018-872e-44f5-ba9a-dddaf1f68f56.png)


Quick sort: picking a pivot

### Tries (LAST CHAPTER!!)

Imagine a Trie that has bunch of words, you want the nodes to be like

```
class Node {
  char ch;
  boolean isKey; // is this a end character of a word?
  DataIndexedCharMap<Node> next; // some big ass array
}
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41399709/164624750-4d3c810e-6159-46b9-8f53-bcea3298900e.png)


Optimizing Trie

-> Ternary Search Tree

Left (looking for character less than current, middle is the trie path, right is parallel)

Basically left right is the same level
