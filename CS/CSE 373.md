Welp shit got lost

But basically 

Big O is one big generalization (They are often wrong)

The Design Decision processs:
1. Evaluate pros and cons
2. Decide on a design
3. Defend your design decision


## Algorithmic Analysis

### Code Modeling

- Cost Model: An anaylsis mindest to express the resource whose growth rate is being measured
- For simplicity, we'll discuss everything in terms of run time today
  - But other cost mdoels exist! For example, storage space is common

### Asymptotic Analysis

I know this

But Big O is like the sig fig.


We do this precise estimation because It's almost impossible to stare at code and know the "true" constants.
