Welp shit got lost

But basically 

Big O is one big generalization (They are often wrong)

The Design Decision processs:
1. Evaluate pros and cons
2. Decide on a design
3. Defend your design decision


## Algorithmic Analysis

### Code Modeling

- Cost Model: An anaylsis mindest to express the resource whose growth rate is being measured
- For simplicity, we'll discuss everything in terms of run time today
  - But other cost mdoels exist! For example, storage space is common

### Asymptotic Analysis

I know this

But Big O is like the sig fig.


We do this precise estimation because It's almost impossible to stare at code and know the "true" constants.

In real life application, real constant run time does matter.

But reason we want Big O analysis is

#### Big O Does not have to be tight.

ex) 10n<sup>2</sup> is O(n<sup>3</sup>) because Big O is simply just an upper bound

#### Big - &Omega;

Omega is the lower bound and also it doesn't have to be tight.

#### Big &theta;

Big &theta; is "equal to"
- My code takes "exactly" this long to run
- Except for constant factors and lower order terms
- Only exist when big O == Big Omega

### Case Analysis

Case: a description of inputs/state for an algorithm that is specific enough to build a code model (runtime function) whose only parameter is the input size
- Case Analysis is our tool for reasoning about all vriation other than n
- Occurs during the code -> function step instead of function 0 -> analysis

Case Anaylsis is seperate from Asymptotic analysis

Case Analysis when runtime is affected by something other than n

ex) Linear Search vs isPrime method

In industry what they mean by big-O is "Tight Big O"

So this is what it means to do case analysis (Probably useless in job interviews)

However maybe could be discussed on the job.



When to do case analysis
1. Can you exit loops early?
2. Can you return early?
3. Are some branches slower than others?

Determine "what" inputs can cause different outcomes not how big.

Best case in case analysis has to be consistent even with growing size of n
